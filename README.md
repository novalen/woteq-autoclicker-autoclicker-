## What is WOTEQ AutoClicker?

WOTEQ AutoClicker is a smart automation tool that records user actions such as mouse clicks, drag-and-drop movements, and keyboard inputs at specific locations on your screen. You can then play back these recorded actions in a loop, eliminating the need for manual intervention. This is particularly useful for automating tasks in games like Roblox and Minecraft, or for streamlining data entry and other office-related work.

- **Advanced Action Recording:** Go beyond simple clicks. You can record a variety of mouse actions, including single left and right clicks, drag-and-drop actions, and even keyboard inputs at specified coordinates.
- **Customizable Hotkeys:** For your convenience, you can set your own hotkeys to start and stop recording, as well as to initiate and halt the playback of your automated tasks.
- **Flexible Delay Configuration:** Tailor the timing between actions to your specific needs. You have multiple options for setting delays, including a fixed delay, using the actual recorded intervals, or setting a random delay for more human-like automation.
- **Loop Your Actions:** Easily repeat a sequence of recorded steps by setting the desired number of loops. This is perfect for tasks that need to be performed multiple times without your attention.
- **Edit and Fine-Tune Steps:** After recording, you have the ability to modify each individual step. You can change the screen coordinates, the type of action, and the delay to perfect your automated sequence.
- **Save and Load Profiles:** WOTEQ AutoClicker allows you to save your recorded steps as a shareable XML file. This means you can save complex automation sequences for later use, load them instantly, and even share them with other users.

> With its intuitive interface and robust set of features, WOTEQ AutoClicker is an excellent choice for anyone looking to automate repetitive digital tasks, enhance their gaming experience, or improve their workflow efficiency.
